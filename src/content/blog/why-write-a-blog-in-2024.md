description: There are many benefits to writing a blog as a full stack software developer.  Technical writing skills are important for advancing your career as a software engineer, but it takes time and effort for the results to begin to show.
---

There's many reasons to start writing, and there's just as many reasons that it will not be easy. Yet, writing is a skill that separates the junior developers from the principal engineers. The ability to write documentation as a reflex is something I admired about all the senior engineers I have ever worked with. If I wanted to be like them, I realized I needed to act like them. This is why I began writing a blog in 2024.

## Why bother?

After working as a developer for over 3 years, I began to ask myself, "Well, what's next?". I really enjoyed building things as a software engineer, and I had been doing it for some time and was beginning to feel confident in my skills I had built over the last few years. I wanted to invest more time and effort into growing my career, so I asked all the senior developers and my managers what I needed to do to become a senior software engineer. Much to my surprise, their answers were to improve my writing skills and to build a blog to practice sharing my knowledge with others.

At first, I didn't think blogging was really something I could accomplish.

> What would I write about?

> I'm already busy enough, how can I even keep up with it?

> Who would even read it? And why would they listen to me?

These were all questions I used to convince myself that I shouldn't start blogging. It wasn't until I actually answered those questions that I began to see the benefits of writing down my thoughts and experiences and putting them out there for the world to consume.

## The Benefits of Blogging

### Personal growth and career development

Keeping a log of your personal growth is helpful when you ever start to doubt yourself. Writing skills are important for advancing your career as a software engineer. Being able to solidify your thought process into something someone else can understand takes practice, and will aid your growth as a software engineer.

### Contributing to the technical community

I cannot count the number of articles that have helped me along the course of my career. Solving all sorts of problems wouldn't have been possible for me if another developer hadn't documented and shared their experience to help me face the same problems they have already worked through. The very least I could do is to give back and share my knowledge with other people who are following the same path.

### Creating new opportunities and connections

I hope by keeping up with this blog, I will be able to create good excuses to try and experiment with new things. By writing a blog, I can demonstrate my communication skills before people even hear my voice. Sharing my knowledge and expertise can help me connect with people who are looking for someone like me.

### Building a personal brand and online presence

In my experience as a full stack developer, it's easy to get lost when defining my skill set while explaining what I do to others. I'm expecting that writing posts consistently will give me the opportunity to define myself in a better way and figure out my personal brand. Expanding my online presence could lead to unique opportunities and will help establish myself as an expert in my field.

### Strengthening technical skills and knowledge

Software development is a never-ending quest of knowledge. There is no limit to amount of stuff to learn as a software engineer, and there will never be enough content to ever satisfy the knowledge needed to be a great engineer. Condensing my thoughts into a written document will help improve my skills as a developer and will increase my knowledge in whatever I decide to write about.

## Challenges of Writing a Blog

Writing a blog isn't all sunshine and rainbows. This is something I know is going to take some time and effort, and understanding the obstacles that will come will help me avoid making the mistakes that will keep me from my goals.

### Finding the time and motivation to consistently write

I will be the first to admit that keeping up with a routine is not my strongest quality. Finding the source of my motivation is something I am still working on. I have a tendency to find more motivation when I fully understand the benefits of the actions and struggles I am putting myself through. My current goal is to at least write a blog post once a month. It is a goal that is not too small, yet not big enough to scare me from trying.

### Dealing with imposter syndrome

Imposter syndrome is another personal challenge for me. Realizing that I actually do have something to share with the world is something I hope to discover as I write this blog. Opening up my thoughts and experiences to criticism will not only make me a better developer, but it will help me become a better person.

### Choosing a niche or focus area

As someone who has been doing full stack web development their entire career, I feel like I have spent enough time to begin to understand what I like and don't like about the technology I use everyday. I find myself enjoying the backend work more than the frontend work, but I also find myself struggling to demonstrate my backend work in my portfolio. I am also at a point in my career where I believe I really need to narrow down my skill set to better market myself.

## Conclusion

Writing a blog is not going to be easy, but it will be a rewarding experience and will open a lot of doors for me in my journey as a software engineer. Sharing my journey with others can inspire and create new connections with other people who are struggling with the same problems that I have.
